Management Strategy The purpose of the Change Management Strategy (ChMS) is to guide the Change Management activities within the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of the Director (OD) IT Cybersecurity directorate in support of Cyber Modernization Task Area 7.10:  Change Management Strategy.', 'The overall purpose of this Change Management Strategy is to document and inform NIH Office of the Director Program stakeholders about ChM processes, recommend ChM tool(s), as well as how they can be applied to fulfill the Cyber Modernization Assessment needs.', 'This Change Management Strategy (ChMS) also defines and recommends the ChM strategic procedures of controlling, tracking and documenting changes to baseline(s) that will be developed and maintained by the NIH OD Support Team.', 'This Strategy further serves to ensure that the established baseline(s) evolve in an orderly, structured and documented manner.', 'The ChMS also documents standard ChM practices for Standard Operating Procedures (SOP), deployments, software and hardware asset management, CI tracking, educational materials, as well as software and hardware auditing.', 'The NIH OD Program ChM Strategy defines and recommends the structure and scope as: Identifying, defining, baselining, and auditing Configuration Items (CI) Controlling modifications, versions, and releases of CIs Reporting and recording status of CIs and any requested modifications Controlling preserving, handling, and delivery of CIs Establishing an approval process for controlling and maintaining change requests Developing a standard published acceptance criterion which ensures that the proposed modifications do not adversely affect the environment or deployments Creating Educational and Training Materials for NIH OD Change Management Stakeholders  Scope The National Institutes of Health (NIH) OD solicited an independent holistic assessment of the maturity of security, supporting processes, and enabling tools.', 'This includes assessing the NIH OD-wide information technology (IT) strategy for security and operations, enabling advanced technology, and recommending opportunities for operational efficiencies.', 'The NIH OD includes the Office of Research Services (ORS), the Office of Research Facilities (ORF), the Office of Internet Technology (OIT), and the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO).', 'Each of these entities are critical in the day-to-day functions for the NIH and provide a multitude of services such as IT governance, policy oversight, financial business systems, and  Cybersecurity IT services.', 'Notwithstanding, these four entities often lack the ability to cohesively communicate across their technical, operational, and functional capabilities (250+ active systems and 42 operational boundaries).', 'As such, the ability to successfully implement a Change Management program into such complex institutions requires a comprehensive integration of organizational buy-in, technical understanding, as well as a team of knowledgeable stakeholders to participate.', 'Moreover, the fundamental objective of this documentation is to recommend unifying various systems, policies and processes across the NIH OD.', 'The nature of this scope is specifically tailored for the NIH OD; however, it can be incorporated into various environments across all four NIH entities, as well as implemented enterprise wide (with the HHS).', 'The following recommendations illustrate the all-encompassing scope for implementing an effective Change Management Strategy:  Designate an NIH OD Change Manager: The individual selected for this role should be acquainted with the framework established for Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL®) V3 or V4 Foundation, the core concepts of operational technology, general computer security concepts (IT), service management, and communication protocols such as those used in networking and Project Management.', 'Define the role and responsibilities for the NIH OD Change Manager.', 'Designate an NIH OD Deputy Change Manager.', 'This individual should have a similar skillset as the primary Change Manager.', 'Define the role and responsibilities for the NIH OD Deputy Change Manager.', 'Designate an NIH OD Release/Deployment Manager.', 'This role does not presently exist in the NIH OD; however, it is necessary for all implementation/deployment activities.', 'Establish controls and enforce development processes from requirements definition through release/deployment.', 'Determine all required NIH OD Change Management Stakeholders.', 'These individuals will have a stake in the activities, policies and procedures for the program.', \"Develop an NIH OD Change Management Charter:  The Charter outlines the NIH OD Change Management Team's mission for identifying change criteria, implementation, goals, objectives, and sets the overall direction for the members/stakeholders.\", 'Develop an NIH OD Change Management Policy: The purpose of the Policy is to explain how the NIH OD will manage changes in a well-communicated, standardized and predictable manner that minimizes unplanned outages and unforeseen system issues.', 'Explain how Change control to will with NIH OD regulations.', 'Develop NIH OD Change Management Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs): As the NIH OD deems necessary, any improvements made to the Change Management processes, will require formally defined and documented procedures.', 'Updating SOPs provides a method to train and communicate the process changes to employees.', 'Embrace the fact that change is required throughout the NIH OD  (e.g., organizational, financial, accountability, services) in order to implement a proper Change Management program.', 'Clarify how the four NIH entities are unique in nature organizationally, but can communicate across IT/operational systems.', 'Establish a baseline for each entity or operational program within the (CMDB) Configuration Management Database, IT system, or functionality, (e.g., DHS: servers, computers, and HHS: enterprise wise, medical equipment), Organizational Changes, Personnel, FACNet.', 'The single most critical factor in a successful CMDB rollout is the process that it most directly supports, i.e.', 'Change Management.', 'Determine which NIH entities/verticals (if any), will combine or cross-communicate Determine which current Change Management applications can be leveraged, and/or procured across multiple NIH entities.', 'Designate which tools are better suited for Facilities Network (FACNet) Change Requests.', 'Designate which tools are better suited for CIT/IT related Change Requests.', 'Examine any program gaps that need to be filled or accurately categorize missing assets as either operational or financial risks.', 'Reconcile all baselined data with that of the current NIH Cybersecurity system of record.', 'Ensure due diligence is carried out to assess the business or risks impact of any asset, hardware, or software change request.', 'Recognize the type of change early on and determine its impact through appropriate risk analysis Define techniques for facilitating modification of system specifications during engineering change processes.', 'Suggest the manner in which the NIH OD Change Manager will perform annual Physical Configuration Audits (PCA) and Functional Configuration Audits (FCA).', 'Approach  It is recommended that NID OD utilize the policies and processes of the Information Technology Information Library (ITIL) V3 framework for its Change Management.', 'The endorsement to adopt a robust ITIL V3 approach for Change Management Strategy will create a smoother transition so that changes are accurate, controlled and delivered with minimal disruption to the NIH OD’s Cybersecurity services.', 'Creating a strategy for change further helps to eliminate or mitigate risks by examining the things that could potentially go wrong and creating a plan to avoid them.', 'Preparing for changes can also involve managing expectations by ensuring all stakeholders comprehend how the new technology will and will not affect the NIH OD.', 'The Change Management Strategy also includes cybersecurity modernization recommendations that are developed to provide an actionable approach to manage cybersecurity risk(s) and protect the essential functions of the various environments at the NIH OD.', 'The approach strategically lays out factors such as the budget, timeline, breadth, communication plan and/or required resources.', 'A thoroughly detailed approach, especially for such a large, intricate change management initiative can more easily be communicated to others, including key NIH OD stakeholders and employees.', 'Current processing, recording and monitoring of change requests for Configuration Items (CIs) is inadequate.', 'The NIH OD should consider leveraging existing software technology tools such as ServiceNow, Maximo or ForeScout.', 'The recommended approach would be procuring three complete systems for each CMDB,  (Development, Test and Production systems) that can be independently accessed by authorized personnel.', 'At a minimum there should be a Test system with the Production system, (used for patches and upgrades, i.e.', 'operating systems and applications) with testing performed prior to implementation in Production.', 'The Change Management approach will further begin with supporting the NIH OD’s Cybersecurity posture readiness for change by determining what requirements to take into consideration before the new strategy initiatives are in place.', 'Thus, collaboration across other Cybersecurity functional areas (ex.', 'Task Areas: Risk Management, DLP Management, Asset Management, Patch Management, etc.)', 'is essential during this process.', 'This joint effort amongst the task areas will provide a roadmap of tactical initiatives to improve the NIH OD’s Cybersecurity organizational maturity.', 'A brief summation for each of the above-mentioned Task Areas is described below in this approach.', 'Change Management’s Relevancy to Risk Management:   Change Management’s relevancy to Risk Management activities provides a flexible way to capture information from the end user or requester to calculate the risk of each associated change request.', 'There are several methods to achieve this.', 'The first entails performing a risk assessment or evaluation of the NIH OD’s Change Management policies and the procedural manner in which change requests are processed.', 'The process further involves analyzing, identifying, understanding, managing and reporting on the risks that the NIH OD Program will face throughout the lifecycle of the change implementation.', 'The NIH OD Change Manager will review risk assessment results provided by the end user or requester.', 'NIH OD Change Manager along with the Risk Manager should present risk(s) during each Change Advisory Board meeting to allow stakeholders the opportunity to analyze the impacts of the risk assessment criteria before voting on each change request.', 'Figure 1:  Risk Assessment Criteria  Change Management’s Relevancy to Asset Management:   By recording all software/hardware components (configuration items) within a centralized database NIH OD can eliminate confusion (e.g.', 'versions, quantity, location) and lost devices.', 'This includes software licenses, asset warranties, certificates of authenticity and any other relevant documentation.', 'One of the most important aspects of asset/information management is to understand the implications of validating changes to those resources.', 'Therefore, the NIH OD Change Manager and Asset Manager shall work together to establish a cohesive method of recording asset location, storage and retrieval, change requests, CAB voting/decisions, as well as NIH OD governance expectations.', 'Hardware, software and documentation asset considerations are detailed as follows:   Hardware Asset Management: the process of tracking and managing the physical components of computers and computer networks/switches from acquisition, CAB review and approval, through EOL.', 'A key component of hardware management is the initial and ongoing inventory or discovery of what the NIH OD currently owns and its current physical condition, in addition to annual physical audits.', 'Software Asset Management: is similar to hardware asset management, however its focuses are on software assets, including licenses, versions, and installed endpoints.', 'The goal of software asset management is to reduce IT costs and limit business, legal and security risks related to the ownership and use of computer software, while maximizing IT responsiveness and end-user productivity.', 'Document Management:  will be utilized by the NIH Change Manager to capture, track and store electronic documents such as PDFs, word processing files and digital images of paper-based content.', 'These types of assets are in a perpetual cycle of change, and therefore, must be stored and maintained through version control.', 'Having documentation management under the control of the NIH OD Change Manager will guarantee document security, access control, centralized storage, audit trails and streamlined search and retrieval.', 'Change Management’s Relevancy to Data Loss Prevention (DLP):  Data loss prevention (DLP) is a set of tools and processes used to ensure that sensitive data is not lost, misused, or accessed by unauthorized users.', 'Clear and measurable change management at the outset will ensure that the NIH OD’s Cybersecurity Modernization Program is focused on protecting the data that is most important to the organization.', 'Therefore, the NIH OD Change Manager and DLP Manager shall work together to establish a cohesive method of accurately recording data, storage and retrieval, change requests, CAB voting/decisions, as well as NIH OD governance expectations.', 'Retaining a copy of the recovery test plans in the NIH OD Configuration Management Database (CMDB), (to be discussed below), can assist with building or utilizing existing capabilities and knowledge rather than starting from scratch.', 'It also means that when real-life disaster recovery plans are needed, the necessary information will be readily available, reducing the response time.', 'Moreover, storing repeatable recovery plans will reduce the risk of data loss due to errors when maintenance is being run.', 'Change Management’s Relevancy to Patch Management: Change Management is a key component in every stage of the Patch Management process.', 'These two elements make up the core processes executed within an organization’s IT department designed to manage enhancements, updates, incremental fixes, and patches to production systems.', 'This includes application code revisions, system upgrades (e.g., applications, operating systems, and databases), and infrastructure changes (e.g., servers, cabling, routers, and firewalls).', 'As with all system modifications, patches and updates should be performed and tracked through a proper change management advisory board and storage system (e.g., CMDB).', 'It is highly unlikely that an NIH OD division wide patch management program will be successful without proper integration of established change management monitoring, tracking and reporting procedures.', 'As such, all patch/update documentation submitted to the CAB must have an associated contingency or rollback plan included with the change request.', 'It should also be specified what recovery plans are if something goes wrong during/after the application of a patch or update.', 'Change Management’s Relevancy to Vulnerability Management: Vulnerability management is the process in which vulnerabilities in Information Technology are identified and the risks of these vulnerabilities are evaluated.', 'This evaluation leads to correcting the vulnerabilities and removing the risk, or a formal risk acceptance through collaborative efforts via Change Management, CAB stakeholders and Vulnerability Management.', 'A formal Change Request will help initiate and track any known/unknown change activity to the NID OD’s Cybersecurity assets so that they can be remediated.', 'Prior to adding a new applicable IT Asset to a production environment, the IT team should inform the NIH OD Change Manager that they have performed an active vulnerability assessment of the new Cyber Asset – unless it is an asset that models an existing baseline configuration of a previous or other existing Cyber Asset.', 'The IT team should provide the Change Manager with documented results of the assessments conducted, along with the action plan to remediate or mitigate vulnerabilities identified in the assessments.', 'Change Management’s Relevancy to Industrial Control Systems (ICS):  ICS are vital to supporting the NIH OD’s critical infrastructure and maintaining national security.', 'The NIH faces threats from a variety of adversaries whose intentions include gathering intelligence and disrupting critical functions.', 'Since automation systems directly control the process, improper changes have a potential for a tremendous negative impact upon safety, profitability, and compliance.', 'As such, it is essential to thoroughly review, manage, record and maintain all changes made via the Change Advisory Board, CMDB and key Change Management stakeholders.', 'Strategic Approach for a Configuration Management Database (CMDB) Changes to the NIH OD environment can cause disruptions to routine business, as well as create confusion if it is not governed appropriately.', 'When upgrading, implementing and/or changing technology platforms, communication and training are essential to help the transition go as smoothly as possible.', 'Our approach is to leverage cloud-based workflow automation for all Change Management activities across NIH OD; thus, standardizing and streamlining Cybersecurity service operations.', 'NIH OD Change Solution shall maintain all IT related change activities from initial creation, risk-assessment, CI management, patch management, to the completion of change requests.', 'This strategy further includes conducting bi-weekly Change Advisory Board (CAB) meetings to present change requests, seek votes, record decisions, create queries, and manage all CIs.', 'Figure 2: Configuration Management Database Core Components  A Configuration Management Database (CMDB) allows for the development of single view dashboards, logical representations of CIs and identify relationships that comprise the infrastructure of the NIH OD.', 'Detailed queries and reports about these components can be used to monitor the Cybersecurity services – helping to ensure integrity, stability, and uninterrupted operations.', 'NIH OD Change Manager can also create baselines, which are a snapshot of configuration items in the CMDB.', 'Multiple baselines may be created, and the system tracks the changes that have been made per baseline.', 'In addition, a well maintained CMDB with relationships and dependencies will aid the Change Management process by identifying the changes with potential conflicts, risks, expired warranties, and possible disruptions of service due to a change.', 'Thus, the primary objective is to ensure all changes and data in the CMDB, (including CIs, relationships, and documentation), are controlled for efficient resolution of integrity issues.', '(See Table 5 for permission levels).', 'Note: A configuration item (CI) is any component or asset that needs to be managed in order to provide an IT service.', 'The CMDB will be used to build logical representations of CIs and services and will establish the relationships between them.', 'NIH OD Change Manager has the authority to perform the following:  Clean up information in the CMDB.', 'Remove information that is obsolete or invalid  Create categories of CIs such as computers, servers, printers, documentation and software Create CIs models.', 'Models are specific versions or configurations of a CI, such as a Dell Pro 10 Create individual CIs, such as hardware, consumables, and software licenses  Manage CIs by counting software licenses and analyzing unallocated software  Security Impact Analysis Due to the constant state of change, it is important to understand the impact of changes on functionality of existing security controls and in context of organizational risk tolerance.', 'A security impact analysis is incorporated into the documented configuration change control process.', 'Therefore, it is imperative to establish what tasks will need to be performed in order to bring the NIH OD Change Management program into existence and what stakeholders will be responsible for completing each task.', 'The analysis of the security impact of a change occurs when changes are examined and evaluated for adverse effects on security, preferably before they are approved and implemented, but also in the case of emergency/unscheduled changes.', 'Once the changes are implemented and tested, a security impact analysis (and/or assessment) is performed to ensure that the changes have been implemented as approved, and to determine if there are any unanticipated effects of the change on existing security controls.', 'NIH OD Change Manager will work closely with the Security team to ensure that all software and hardware is as secure.', 'The Security team and ChM will validate the release cycle efforts to assure the release cycle efforts have satisfied the security enhancements, while maintaining an operational functionality posture.', 'Security impact analysis supports the implementation of NIST SP 800-53 control CM-4 Security Impact Analysis.', 'Figure 3: Security Impact Analysis   The critical need for the NIH OD to perform a security impact analysis includes the following criteria:  Reduction of long-term costs: Identifying potential threats and vulnerabilities, can prevent or reduce security incidents from causing operations disruptions and reputational damage in the long-term Provides security risk assessment templates for future assessments: Standardized Risk Assessments ensures repeatable processes Better organizational knowledge: Knowing organizational vulnerabilities can assist NIH OD build a clearer roadmap and needs assessments Avoid data breaches: A data breach can create a\\xa0\\xa0on NIH OD  Avoid regulatory issues: Customer data can be hacked or stolen because of a failure to comply with HIPAA or other regulatory acts Avoid application downtime: Internal or customer facing systems need to be available and functioning for NIH OD staff members to perform their jobs Data loss: Theft of trade secrets, code, or other key CIs/assets could mean a loss of business Security impact analysis ensures that changes introduced into the infrastructure do not adversely affect business processes.', 'NIH OD Change Manager and IT stakeholders will utilize methodologies derived from the ITIL framework as the quality approach for defining the security impact analysis process.', 'Change Management has two main components: Change Control and Change Management.', 'This Change Management Strategy addresses both components.', 'Change Control Policies, Standards, and Procedures Change Management (ChM) is the ongoing process of identifying and managing changes to services, assets, and other work-related products.', 'The Change Management Strategy (ChMS) is being recommended to define, document, control, implement, account for, and audit changes to the various components of this Program.', 'It identifies ChM requirements and establishes the methodology for control of releases and changes to Configuration Items.', 'The ChMS also describes the process for maintaining status accounting and verifying the completeness and correctness of Configuration Items throughout the system lifecycle.', 'Change/Configuration Management While maintaining Change control is essential to ensuring a secure network and environment, change management will allow the NIH OD Program to grow, adopt, and respond to any problems, upgrades and opportunities.', 'NIH OD Program must formally review and approve all requested changes to software, hardware, data, networks, or documentation in order to exhaustively evaluate the effect of the change on security, performance, financial capacity, acceptability, completeness, and documentation.', 'Background Authentication to systems in the NIH OD comply with Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12) mandates and leverage active directory credentials with personal identity verification (PIV) as a secondary factor.', 'In most cases, the hosted systems leverage federated access through Single Sign On (SSO) services that are provided by the CIT Identity and Access Management (IAM) team.', 'There are a few exceptions where systems leverage the hosting infrastructure of an external entity and do not conform to internal NIH OD standards.', 'Referenced Change Management Documents The documents that support the Change Management Strategy are listed below in Table 1.', 'The NIH OD Program will continually update the documents and table to reflect any future changes or revisions.', 'Table 1: Referenced Change Management Documents Referenced Change Management Process Chart This ChMS incorporates several of the standard ChM processes for the NIH OD Program based on the following core Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI®) ChM Strategy process areas.', 'The logical activities, methodology and relationships supporting the CMMI Change Management process flow are listed below in Table 2 for various ChM related activities.', 'Table 2: Change Management Product and Service Process Chart  Change Management Strategy (ChMS) Structure Developing a ChM Strategy program begins with Configuration Identification (CI); however, this ChMS details the Change Advisory Board (CAB) membership and process first, because the CAB is the primary ChM mechanism to control changes to the NIH OD’s mission environment.', 'The ChMS defines the CAB membership roles and responsibilities in Section 2, then describes the CAB process in Section 3.', 'Following the CAB sections, the ChMS lists NIH OD Program’s Configuration Items (CIs) in Section 4 and concludes with the auditing and documentation processes for these CIs in Section 5.', 'NIH OD Change Management (ChM) Roles and Responsibilities NIH OD Change Advisory Board (CAB) Membership Various levels of stakeholders/participants comprise the CAB: CAB Facilitator (the Change Manager), NIH OD Stakeholders, CAB Advisory Members, and Supporting CAB Participants.', 'The NIH OD NIH OD Program Change Manager (ChM) facilitates the CAB, and the NIH OD Program Manager or Deputy PM will act as the alternate facilitator (if required).', 'Table 3 shows which individuals provide which level of CAB

'NIH OD CAB and Change Request Processes  NIH OD Change Advisory Board (CAB) Introduction The goal of the Change Advisory Board (CAB) is to ensure that NIH OD formally presents, reviews, and approves all relevant information for proposed change(s).', 'The CAB is primarily the forum to control changes to the NIH OD production environment (e.g., deployment of new software/hardware); however, any change(s) with significant cross-organizational impact should involve the CAB as well.', 'Approved change requests (RFCs) and meeting minutes document the CAB’s consideration of an issue.', 'The CAB Facilitator (the Change Manager) acts as the meeting moderator, allowing all participants to express their views and opinions of the proposed change(s).', 'Conduct of NIH OD Change Advisory Board (CAB) It is primarily the responsibility of the Change Manager (ChM) to prepare for and support CAB meetings on behalf of the NIH OD Stakeholders.', 'Expanding on the ChM responsibilities in Section 2, this section details pre-meetings, active meetings and post-meeting actions and duties.', 'NIH OD Program Change Advisory Board (CAB) Pre-Meeting Duties and Activities  The NIH OD Program CAB Pre-Meeting duties and activities include: The ChM sends an initial invitation via email to stakeholders that wish to participate in the CAB meeting.', 'The ChM maintains and updates (as required) the distribution email list for the CAB meeting.', 'The ChM gathers all change request documentation submitted from each RFC requestor.', 'The ChM uses these Requests for Change documents to develop the
